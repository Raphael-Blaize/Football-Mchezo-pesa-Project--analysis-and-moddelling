## Dataset Description

You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.

A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

You have two possible approaches (as  shown below) given the datasets that will be provided

Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)

Approach 1: Polynomial approach

What to train given:

Rank of home team
Rank of away team
Tournament type
Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home teamâ€™s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective

A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics

```python
import pandas as pd # python library that import datasets into a working env and does so much more such as helping in cleaning datasets etc
import numpy as np # offers comprehensive mathematical functions etc
```

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning - involves taking care of missing data, outliers and duplicates before after merging the datasets
- Data Analysis 
- Modelling
